                    Hey! I'm Jianmin Chen. I typically go by a variation of my
                    name online - that is, "jchen" or "jianmin-chen" or "jc" or
                    "jianminchen". (And counting, depending on whether my name's
                    been taken or not. It's surprising how a rare name like
                    mine's can be so common). In real life, I go by "Amanda"
                    since most people have trouble pronouncing my name. I put
                    the pro in procrastinator by working on multiple projects at
                    any given time and pretending like I'll definitely be able
                    to finish them. In my free time, I also love playing the
                    guitar (note: should probably start playing more often,
                    quite frankly), reading (I read a lot), running (I normally
                    run a lot, although this summer I've been biking more -
                    around 6~ miles a day to and from work), and stressing over
                    the smallest things (no, I don't have a rubber duck to
                    stress and debug with me). You can catch me at the following
                    places:

                    in real life.) I discovered programming when I found an

                    (I don't know if it can be considered a pastime anymore), as
                    long as I don't feel pressured to do it. (I think not
                    enjoying being pressured to do something applies to a lot of
                    things, but especially learning. Take that, public school
                    system!) (Yes, I also procrastinate when it comes to

                <h1>I'm trying to live by a set of values.</h1>
                <p>
                    Ever since I read
                    <a href="https://sarthakmohanty.me/manifesto">this</a>, I've
                    been thinking: what are the values I want to live by?
                    Recently, I've been struggling. I'm not sure what I want to
                    do or what direction I want to go in (quite the teenage
                    dilemna, I'll admit). My emotions have been fluctuating and
                    I'm trying to put a finger on something, something for
                    stability. I just don't know... what.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I read the manifesto (that I've linked), I see a way
                    out: the very least I can do is live by a set of values. No
                    matter what happens, I can live by a set of values that I
                    believe in. And as I thought about it, I realized: I'm
                    already doing this. I believe in these values, and I've been
                    trying to live by them.
                </p>
                <h2>1. You're on your own, kid.</h2>
                <p>
                    This is intentionally taken off from a song from Taylor
                    Swift's
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights"
                        >Midnights</a
                    >, where she sings, "You're on your own, kid". When I heard
                    it, I instantly knew that while it wasn't my favorite song
                    off the album, it was the most meaningful to me, personally.
                    Ultimately: I'm on my own. I'm responsible for my own
                    success and failures. If I make a mistake, it's up to me to
                    fix. If I want something, I gotta go get it myself. I can't
                    wait around, waiting for something to come to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I've been thinking of this in terms of my
                    indecision. If I want to make a change, I need to step up my
                    game. No one's going to save me; it's up to me to finally
                    decide to do something.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Things are easier than they seem.</h2>
                <p>
                    This has become a pattern in my life. I have anxiety, but
                    lately, I've been slowly getting over it by simply asking:
                    am I blowing things out of proportion? I blow too many
                    things out of proportion, when the solution is simple: just
                    do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More importantly, if you make a mistake, you can fix it.
                    There's always a alternate route. This has given me so much
                    peace, just coming to terms with this fact.
                </p>
                <p>That's it, so far. Thanks for reading.</p>

                    After I saw

                    creating a server from scratch in C, I decided to try it out
                    for myself, but in Python. I ended up writing around 170
                    lines of (pretty bad) code, and I added a couple extra
                    features:

                        on the backend and then being served on the frontend,
                        using a custom templating engine (of sorts, haha).

                    I've got a couple of secret projects I'm working on. They're
                    pretty big scale, so sign up for the newsletter on my
                    <a href="https://jianminchen.com">blog</a>
                    to be notified when they release! 😉

                    Other than that, check out my GitHub for my smaller
                    projects. I'll include projects here when I have the time.
